Page 162 2.3.1.4 (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename administrator account' (Automated) Profile Applicability: \u2022 Level 1 - Domain Controller \u2022 Level 1 - Member Server Description: The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console). On Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the built-in Administrator account that was established when the domain was first created. Rationale: The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination. The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on. Impact: You will have to inform users who are authorized to use this account of the new account name. (The guidance for this setting assumes that the Administrator account was not disabled, which was recommended earlier in this chapter.) Audit: Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as prescribed.

Page 164 2.3.1.5 (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename guest account' (Automated) Profile Applicability: \u2022 Level 1 - Domain Controller \u2022 Level 1 - Member Server Description: The built-in local guest account is another well-known name to attackers. It is recommended to rename this account to something that does not indicate its purpose. Even if you disable this account, which is recommended, ensure that you rename it for added security. On Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the built-in Guest account that was established when the domain was first created. Rationale: The Guest account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination. Impact: There should be little impact, because the Guest account is disabled by default. Audit: Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as prescribed. To establish the recommended configuration via GP, configure the following UI path: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Accounts: Rename guest account Default Value: Guest.

Note #2: When you configure this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the first object on the list, press the Enter button, type the next object, press Enter again, etc. The setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in group policy security templates. It is also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group Policy Editor's display pane and the Resultant Set of Policy console.

The recommended state for this setting is: System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\ProductOptions System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Server Applications Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion Rationale: The registry is a database that contains computer configuration information, and much of the information is sensitive. An attacker could use this information to facilitate unauthorized activities. To reduce the risk of such an attack, suitable ACLs are assigned throughout the registry to help protect it from access by unauthorized users. Impact: None - this is the default behavior. However, if you remove the default registry paths from the list of accessible ones, remote management tools such as the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and Microsoft Systems Management Server could fail, as they require remote access to the registry to properly monitor and manage computers.
